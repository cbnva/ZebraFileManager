# Zebra File Manager
Manages files on Zebra printers. Developed/Tested on QLn320

## State ##
Alpha product. It'll probably work, but no guarantees.

I'm probably not going to fix problems I'm not having, but you're more than welcome to.

I wrote this as an internal tool for work, and it does what I need.

There are basically no error checks, comments, or good coding practices. Again, feel free to improve it.

## Features ##
- Connects over IP (LAN/WLAN) to port 9100
- Drag/drop files to/from printer
- Rename Files
- Delete Files

## Future Plans ##
- USB connection
